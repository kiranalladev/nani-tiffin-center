      <p>
        Nani Tiffin Center started in 1990 as a small village style tiffin shop with a simple goal:
        to serve hot, homely breakfast that feels like it is made in your own kitchen. Over the years,
        we have grown with the love of our regular customers, but we still follow the same recipes and
        the same care in every plate we serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        From soft idlis to crispy dosas, every tiffin is prepared fresh every morning using quality
        ingredients. We believe in honest pricing, clean cooking and a friendly atmosphere where
        everyone feels welcome.
      </p>
